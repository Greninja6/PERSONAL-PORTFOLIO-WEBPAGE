#DESCRIPTION:
This project is a personal developer portfolio website created to showcase my academic and internship projects in an organized and professional way. The website includes multiple sections such as About, Skills, Projects, and Contact with smooth scrolling navigation across the page. Each section is designed to clearly present my technical abilities, learning journey, and practical experience in web development. It highlights important works including Academix, Quest Window, Chat Application, and other college projects to represent both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate frontend development skills, layout structuring, and responsive user interface design. The interface is simple, clean, and readable so that visitors can easily understand the content without distraction. Proper spacing, color contrast, and typography are used to improve user experience and maintain a professional appearance.

The website is lightweight and optimized for fast loading performance. It adapts to different screen sizes and works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices without breaking layout structure. This project reflects understanding of modern UI design principles and the ability to present information effectively through a well-structured web interface.
