#DESCRIPTION:
This project is a personal developer portfolio website created to present my academic and internship work in a clear and organized manner. The purpose of this website is to act as a simple online profile where anyone can view my basic information, technical skills, and projects without needing a resume file. The project focuses on layout structure and presentation rather than advanced functionality.

The website is divided into sections such as About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. The About section introduces me and briefly explains my interest in web development. The Skills section lists the technologies I have learned during college and practice work. The Projects section displays my major works including Academix, Quest Window, Chat Application, and other small projects. Each project has a short explanation so visitors can understand what it does. The Contact section provides basic contact details.

Navigation is implemented using simple anchor links so users can smoothly move across the page. The site does not contain login systems, forms connected to databases, or backend processing. It is purely a front-end informational website created to practice structuring content and presenting it neatly.

The design is kept minimal to maintain readability. Basic colors, spacing, and alignment are used so the information remains the main focus. The layout adjusts to different screen sizes and works on mobile and desktop devices without breaking. The project helped in understanding how to organize content visually and how to maintain consistent styling across sections.

This project demonstrates knowledge of semantic HTML, CSS layout handling, and responsive design principles. It also shows the ability to present personal work in a structured way using simple web technologies.
